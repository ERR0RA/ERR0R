    <p>Lets start of with simple equations . An example of a simple equasion is x + 3 = 8</p>
    <p>To work this out we need to bring 3 to the oither side , so we subtract three from both sides to get x + 3 -3 + 8 - 3</p>
    <p>This makes x = 5</p>
</div>
    <p>Here is another example (the answer will be told later in the harder questions) x + 3 = 8</p>
<div>
        <p>Now let's look at another equation , but with a negative sign . </p>
        <p>x - 5 = 9</p>
        <p>To remove the five we need to add five to the 'x' side , and add five to the oter side.</p>
        <p>So we get x - 5 + 5 = 9 + 5</p>
        <p>This gets us to x = 9 +5</p>
        <p>So x = 14</p>
