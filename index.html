    Look at this: \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) \(\sqrt{x}\)

    <p>This is a revision guide to help with almost every possible maths question. This will be updated frequently, and also any questions please ask.</p>

        <h3>Algebra</h3>
        <p>Let's start off with simple equations. An example of a simple equation is x + 3 = 8.</p>
        <p>To work this out we need to bring 3 to the other side, so we subtract 3 from both sides to get x + 3 - 3 = 8 - 3.</p>
        <p>This makes x = 5.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Here is another example (the answer will be told later in the harder questions): x + 3 = 8.</p>

        <p>Now let's look at another equation, but with a negative sign.</p>
        <p>x - 5 = 9</p>
        <p>To remove the 5 we need to add 5 to the x side, and add 5 to the other side.</p>
        <p>So we get x - 5 + 5 = 9 + 5.</p>
        <p>This gets us to x = 14.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Answer for example questions before this one is x = 5</p>
