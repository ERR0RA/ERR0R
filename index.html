    Look at this: \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) \(\sqrt{x}\)

    <p>This is a revision guide to help with almost every possible maths question. This will be updated frequently, and also any questions please ask.</p>

        <h3>One step to two step equations</h3>
        <p>Let's start off with simple/ one step equations. An example of a simple equation / one step equation is x + 3 = 8.</p>
        <p>To work this out we need to bring 3 to the other side, so we subtract 3 from both sides to get x + 3 - 3 = 8 - 3.</p>
        <p>This makes x = 5.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Here is another example (the answer will be told later in the harder questions): x + 3 = 8.</p>

         <p>Here is another example (the answer will be told later in the harder questions): x + 3 = 8.</p>
         <hr>
        <p>Now let's look at another equation, but with a negative sign.</p>
        <p>x - 5 = 9</p>
        <p>To remove the 5 we need to add 5 to the x side, and add 5 to the other side.</p>
        <p>So we get x - 5 + 5 = 9 + 5.</p>
        <p>This gets us to x = 14.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Answer for example questions before this one is x = 5</p>

        <p>Let's look at harder questions , as those are easy.</p>
        <p>2x - 4 = 8 - 3</p>
        <p>We should start with the side without x , as we can easily subtract 3 from 8</p>
        <p>So now we have 2x - 4 = 5</p>
        <p>As we learned before we need to get negative four on the other side , so we need to add for on both sides</p>
        <p>This get's us 2x = 9</p>
        <p>Now you be thinking what do with 2x I need x so to get x we divide 2x and nine by 2 , because we are finding x ( we have to divide both sides otherwise the equation would be incrorect</p>
        <p>This get's us 2x / 2 = 9 / 2</p>
        <p> 2x divided by 2 is x and 9/2 is 4.5</p>
        <p> so X = 4.5</p>
        <hr>
        <p> Here are a few questions for you to solve </p>
        <p> 1. 2x + 3 = 1 -5 </p>
        <p>2. 3x + 1 = 9 + 1</p>
        <p>3. x - 2 + 4 = 2 -1 </p>
        <hr>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Here are the answers</p>
        <p>1.  2x + 3 = - 4</p>
        <p>    2x = -7</p>
        <p>    x = - 7 / 2 </p>
        <p>    x = 3.5</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>2.  3x + 1 = 10 </p>
        <p>    3x = 9</p>
        <p>    x = 9 / 3</p>
        <p>     x = 3 </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>3.  x -2 + 4 = 2 -1 can be simplified to x + 2 = 1</p>
        <p>If we bring the 2 to the other side we get x = -2 + 1</p>
        <p>This means x = -1 </p>

    <h1>Expanding single and double brackets easy to hard</h1>
    <p>To expand single brackets we times whatever is outside the bracket to whatever is inside the bracket</p>
    <p1>Here is some examples</p1>
    
    <p>1. 2x(y + 2 ) = 2xy + 4x </p>
    
    <p>2. 3(2x + 5 )= 6x + 15 </p>
    
    <p>3. x( 1 + 4 ) = x + 4x = 5x</p>
<hr>
    <p></p>
    <p>Now let's look at harder equations </p>
    <p>2x(3y - 1 ) - 2x(4y + 5)</p>
    <p>If we expand this we get 6xy - 2x - 8xy -10x</p1>
    <p>Now this can be simplified to -2xy -12x</p>
    <p>If we look at this we can put it back in brackets to get its simplest form</p>
    <p>So we can get -2x(y + 6 ) because both have minus sign , 2 and x , we can take them out of the bracket </p>
<hr>
    <p>Here are some questions for YOU to solve </p>
    <p>    1. 3(x + 2 ) - 8(x + 2)</p>
    <p>    2. 4(y - 3 ) + 2(y + 5)</p>

    <h1>Law's of Indecies </h1>
    <p>Law's of indicies are very important and play a key role in mathematics</p>
    <p>Below I will write the law's od indicies</p>
    <p>(x^m)^n + x^m+n</p>
    <p>a^m times a^n = a^m+n</p>
    <p>a^0 = 1</p>
    <p>a^m / a^n = a^m-n</p>
    <p>a^-m = 1 / a^m</p>
    <p>a^m/n = n^√a^m</p>
